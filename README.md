Video Game in windows form apps.

The Player class contains a set of variables that are used to represent the state of a player in a fighting game, such as health, damage, playerImage, PlayerPosition, PlayerWidth, PlayerHeight, speed, isMovingLeft, isMovingRight, isBlocking, isDead, isMoving, isLeft, isRight, isAttacking, isHitted, playeridleimgnum, playermovingimgnum, playeratackingnum, playerdamagedimgnum, and attacksound.

The Player class also contains a set of abstract methods that define the behavior of a player in the game, such as SetPictureBox, Move, setAttackStance, setNormalStance, setBlockStance, setIdleAnimation, PlayerHits, setMovingAnimation, setGetHitted, FlipImage, SetVictorystance, CheckRoundWinner, and SetAtackAnimation.

The Player1/Player2 class is a concrete class that extends the Player class and provides an implementation for the abstract methods. The implementation of the methods in Player1 class are specific to Player1 behavior and are used to set the image, location, and animation of the player in the game.

The "Form1" class represents the main form of the application. It contains various controls such as buttons, timers, progress bars, and images.
The "Engine" class is a custom class that handles the game logic. It contains instances of two player classes, "Player1" and "Player2", and various methods for updating the game state.
