# Fithing-game
I have recently developed a rudimentary video game using Windows Forms applications. This project aims to deliver an engaging fighting game experience for players. The game features a Player class that encompasses various attributes, including health, damage, position, image, and animation. It also incorporates abstract methods that define the behavior of the players in the game.

## Description of the code:

### Player Class:
+ Contains variables for player attributes such as health, damage, image, position, size, speed, and various flags for movement, blocking, and status.
+ Provides abstract methods for setting the player's image, handling movement, stances (attack, normal, block), animations, hit detection, flipping image, victory stance, round winner checking, and attack animation.

### Player1/Player2 Classes:
+ Concrete classes that extend the Player class.
+ Implement specific behavior, such as setting image, location, and animation, for Player1 and Player2.

### Form1 Class:
+ Represents the main application form.
+ Contains controls like buttons, timers, progress bars, and images.
+ Interacts with the game engine to handle user input and update the game state.

### Engine Class:
+ Custom class responsible for game logic.
+ Manages instances of Player1 and Player2 classes.
+ Provides methods for updating game state, handling player interactions, and managing rounds.

## Learning Outcomes:
+ Problem-solving skills and techniques for debugging and troubleshooting cod Good software development practices, such as version control, testing, and documentation.
+ I managed to concretize programming concepts learned from class such as OOP, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance.
+ Collaboration and communication skills for working on software development projects with others.
+ Refine my skills with languages and frameworks, such as C#, .NET, abd Windows Forms.
